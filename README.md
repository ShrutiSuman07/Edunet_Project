Dynamic Developer Portfolio (Shruti Suman)

üåü Project Overview
This repository hosts a personal developer portfolio designed to provide a dynamic, high-performance, and professionally engaging representation of my skills, projects, and professional background. It serves as a centralized hub, moving beyond static resumes to showcase interactive front-end development capabilities.

The portfolio is built with a focus on modern design, mobile-first responsiveness, and smooth user experience, primarily utilizing the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library for scroll-triggered and element animations.

‚ú® Key Features
GSAP-Powered Animations: Smooth, engaging text and section reveal animations on scroll to enhance user experience.

Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Clear Skill Segregation: A dedicated section demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Prompt Engineering, and Python.

Project Showcase: Direct links and summaries for featured work, including the Junior Content Creator-Agribusiness and Space Internship Program.

Professional Contact: Clear paths to connect via email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube.
